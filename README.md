## Description

Sample repository based on [nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) and [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/) framework.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Configuration

You need to rename the `ormconfig-example.json` file to `ormconfig.json` and configure your connection to the database.

> At first, the project is set up for relational database. If you wish to use with MongoDB, for example, you must change the User entity setting to work as expected. More information in [THAT EXAMPLE](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/tree/master/examples/13-mongo-typeorm).

## Start

```
$ npm run start
```
